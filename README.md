## 3. METHODOLOGY

### Project Objective
Harmonize is a web application that enhances communication, understanding, and trust between patients and providers. The application increases providers' visibility and promotes interaction with patients through two methods of online interaction, a blog, and a forum. Patients have a privacy-focused journal (blog), while a blog is provided to the providers to market their services. The forum will create an environment where patients and providers can interact and evaluate each other in group conversations. The application employs social networking features to enhance effective and direct communication and visibility, including liking/un-liking user entries and mentioning users. The use of NLP will further expedite and enhance the ability of the therapist to analyze large volumes of their patient's monitored data. There will be three user types, patient, provider, and admin. All patients will be identified anonymously for privacy. Providers have a choice of anonymity as well. The admin user has access to a visual back-end data management system, which will make it easier to maintain the application's database information.

### 3.1.1 Application Usage Pattern
The user will be presented with the home page, a general landing page for site visitors. The user will have the option to register a new account or log in as an existing user. The registration form will allow users to make their account a "patient" or "provider" user type. Upon registering as a new user, they are automatically logged into their account and redirected to the home page. Upon creating a new account, the new user will have to navigate to the "Edit Account" page, which allows them to enter critical information that will enhance connectivity with other registered patients and providers. If they are actively seeking a provider, the user can enter their general information, make their account non-searchable, choose their current mental health conditions, choose their insurance company, and write a bio about themselves. Every user has a "Landing Page." The landing page is the primary user page for others to visit when looking for another user. It acts as the launching point for everything concerning that user. Page options include:
- View user's blog
- Choose to monitor a user.
- Grant Privacy Access to a user.
- View if a user is actively seeking a provider or accepting new patients.
- View if the blog is searchable (indicating access status to the entire blog).

The patient or provider has access to their journal and blog, respectively. The users' journals and blogs are the same and have different user types (to signify different usage). Each user can write an entry, which can include an image or not. Each blog entry can be "liked" or "unliked" by other users. The user has complete control to set the privacy control of each blog entry to "public" or "private." The user can edit or remove any blog entry they create. When providers are granted private access to a patient's journal, they will see private and public entries. The provider will also have a color-coded sentiment analysis bar visible on each journal entry for quick visual sentiment interpretation. The provider can click on a "View Analysis" button for each journal entry, which takes them to a new page that details the sentiment analysis and Name Entity Recognition for each journal post. This feature enhances the provider's ability to interpret quickly and single out concerning journal entries of potential clients (since they were granted privacy access).

Every registered user has access to the public forum. The public forum consists of "Rooms," which hold conversations about a specific subject. The author of a room can edit or remove any remove they have made. Upon visiting a room, a user can click on a "Conversation," which contains a dialogue between patient and provider user types in response to a conversation starter question. A starter question is always entered by the author of the conversation upon creation. The user has complete control to edit or remove any response they author. All rooms, conversations, and individual responses have links back to their respective author's landing page. If another user wants to learn more about the author, read their blog and like their entries, monitor or grant privacy access to that user. Every user will have their splashboard. The splashboard is an interface that allows users to quickly access valuable data and connections facilitated by the application's social networking features and data relationships. The splashboard has two sections, "General Data Services” and “Provider Data Services.”

*Options for the "General Data Services" include:*
- Journal and blog feed of all users I am monitoring.
- Journal feed of patients I am monitoring.
- List users that granted the current user privacy access.
- Journal and blog feed(s) where the current user is granted privacy access.
- Manage users I am monitoring.
- Manage private access users.
- Who mentioned the current user within the last week?
- Forum conversations of interest.
- Recommended other patient associations (based on conditions).
- Forum response feed of all users I am monitoring.
- Forum response feed of patients I am monitoring.
- Mental Health Crisis Emergency Services Contact Information.
- User raw search by user alias.

*Options for Provider Data Services include:*
- Recommended Provider Associations (Based on Conditions)
- Blog Feed of Providers I Am Monitoring.
- Forum Response Feed of Providers I am Monitoring.
- Providers Who Worked as Out-Of-Network Specialists.
- Where Are Monitored Providers Being Mentioned in Journals?
- Where Are Monitored Providers Being Mentioned in Forum?

Every registered user has a search feature in the navigation, which they can use to search the public forums. The search results will render a paginated list of responses with a breadcrumb link chain of the room, conversation and response. The user can click on any link and access those individual elements. The third type of user, "admin," which is not selectable upon account creation, exists on the system. The admin user has access to the site's administrator section. The admin section is a data management user interface that tabulates the database tables of the website.
