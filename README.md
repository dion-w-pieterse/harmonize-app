# harmonize-app

### METHODOLOGY

## Project Objective
Harmonize is a web application that enhances communication, understanding, and trust between patients and providers. The application increases providers' visibility and promotes interaction with patients through two methods of online interaction, a blog, and a forum. Patients have a privacy-focused journal (blog), while a blog is provided to the providers to market their services. The forum will create an environment where patients and providers can interact and evaluate each other in group conversations. The application employs social networking features to enhance effective and direct communication and visibility, including liking/un-liking user entries and mentioning users. The use of NLP will further expedite and enhance the ability of the therapist to analyze large volumes of their patient's monitored data. There will be three user types, patient, provider, and admin. All patients will be identified anonymously for privacy. Providers have a choice of anonymity as well. The admin user has access to a visual back-end data management system, which will make it easier to maintain the application's database information.
